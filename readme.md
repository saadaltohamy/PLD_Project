# Programming Language Design Project

This repository contains the source code and documentation for our Programming Language Design project.

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to design and implement a new programming language from scratch. The language will have unique features and syntax that differentiate it from existing languages. Our goal is to create a language that is both expressive and efficient, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.
